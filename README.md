# cv_MNIST
This repository contains 2 DL models pertaining to the famous and simple dataset called MNIST which contains handwritten digits.
The other one a little complex dataset which is an extension of the MNIST dataset and its called fashion MNIST dataset.
I worked on both the datasets as far as i could and came up with trained models which anyone can download and use to predict cool images,
be it of your own handwritten digit or a famous shoe you wanted to classify.

The code to train and the model is also provided. You can use it to train your own DL model.

Thanks,
Have fun classifying images!!
